get a list of K place that is closest to [0, 0] in a 2d array  

- Given a sorted dictionary (array of words) of an alien language, find order of characters in the language.
Examples:
Input: words[] = {"baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"}
Output: Order of characters is 'b', 'd', 'a', 'c'  

Interview 1 (Design):

Design an airport service that will be used to allocate a free runway when the plane is about to land. Data structure for the same. What if the runway is not available? Message passing between control centre and the plane. Focus on low-level design and code. Can the same runway be alloted to two different planes (locking)? Database storage needed? 

Interview 2 (Algo):

There is a huge road. Given are the following
 - Array D that stores the distance from a starting point where billboard can be installed.
 - Array C that stores the profit. C[i] -> profit if the billboard is installed at distance D[i].
 - dist -> minimum distance to maintain between the billboards.
Assume you can install any number of billboards while maintaining a given minimum distance 'dist' between each of them.… 

- Given an array of numbers representing the size of the edges, find the number of triplets that can form a triangle.  

- Given coin denomination of 3, 6 and 17, find the number of ways in which you can form a sum 'n'. How will do it for large numbers?
- Design an elevator system (low-level and high-level).

 1st Round:
1. Design Subway Suffers game.
2. what a negative feedback recently you got.
3. Describe recent challenging work done.
2nd Round:
1. Design Resource Pool
2. input a number and check if the sum of two numbers in a BST matches with it.
3 rd Round:
1. Create Doubly link list from a BST
2. given two sorted array a1 and a2 with length m+n and n , a1 has only m elements, Merge a2 to a1 so that elements are in sorted order, don't use 3rd array.
