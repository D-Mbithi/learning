    2)There are rows of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

## HOT QUESTION
    you are given a matrix that has either 0 or 1. You can perform only one operation on matrix. It is to swap two columns of a matrix.
    Your task is to optimally swap these columns such that you get a largest rectangular submatrix that consist of only 1's. Make sure that the no of swap opertion you performed are minimum.  
    given two strings find out total number of occurrences of second string in first string.
