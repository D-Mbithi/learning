Mysql vs PostgresSql

•	MySQL doesn’t support CTE (very big deal!)
•	MySQL doesn’t support window functions (another big deal)
•	Joins: MySQL doesn’t support full outer joins ()
•	Array: MySQL doesn’t support working with arrays
•	PostgreSQL has better/consistent interface when working with date/times
•	PostgreSQL supports VALUES for manual list of values, MySQL you have to do SELECT UNION ALL (quite painful)
•	Various useful functions MySQL doesn’t support: generate_series, string split (into array); generally I find Postgres offers a lot more feature-specific functions than MySQL
•	JSON Support and NoSQL
•	This is a recent addition to PostgreSQL, and it does make the platform more appealing to anyone who wants to try out NoSQL and store JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files in the database
•	It also supports indexing JSON data for faster access.
•	Subqueries were one of MySQL’s major weaknesses for a long time; it was notorious for losing its way with two or more levels of sub-queries. Since 5.6.5, though, there have been major improvements—but PostgreSQL is still considered better for joins especially as MySQL doesn’t support Full Outer Joins.

Mechached Vs Redis
Another scenario in which Memcached has an advantage over Redis is in scaling. Because Memcached is multithreaded, you can easily scale up by giving it more computational resources. Redis, which is mostly single-threaded, can scale horizontally via clustering without loss of data. Clustering is an effective scaling solution, but it is comparatively more complex to set up and operate. Memcached does not support replication.
Memcached is very good to handle high traffic websites. It can read lots of information at a time and give you back at a great response time. Redis can also handle high traffic on read but also can handle heavy writes as well.

Kafka vs RabbitMq
RabbitMQ will keep all states about consumed/acknowledged/unacknowledged messages while Kafka doesn't, it assumes the consumer keep tracks of what's been consumed and not. RabbitMQ's queues are fastest when they're empty, while Kafka retain large amounts of data with very little overhead - Kafka is designed for holding and distributing large volumes of messages. (If you plan to have very long queues in RabbitMQ you could have a look at lazy queues.)
Kafka is built from the ground up with horizontal scaling in mind, while RabbitMQ is mostly designed for vertical scaling.

System architecture[edit]
Collaboration systems utilizing Operational Transformations typically use replicated document storage, where each client has their own copy of the document; clients operate on their local copies in a lock-free, non-blocking manner, and the changes are then propagated to the rest of the clients; this ensures the client high responsiveness in an otherwise high-latency environment such as the Internet. When a client receives the changes propagated from another client, it typically transforms the changes before executing them; the transformation ensures that application-dependent consistency criteria (invariants) are maintained by all sites. This mode of operation results in a system particularly suited for implementing collaboration features, like simultaneous document editing, in a high-latency environment such as the web.

Mutex vs Semaphore
Mutex can be released only by thread that had acquired it, while you can signal semaphore from any other thread (or process), so semaphores are more suitable for some synchronization problems like producer-consumer.
Basic----------------Semaphore is a signalling mechanism.	Mutex is a locking mechanism.
Existence------------Semaphore is an integer variable.	Mutex is an object.
Function-------------Semaphore allow multiple program threads to access a finite instance of resources.	Mutex allow multiple program thread to access a single resource but not simultaneously.
Ownership------------Semaphore value can be changed by any process acquiring or releasing the resource.	Mutex object lock is released only by the process that has acquired the lock on it.
Categorize-----------Semaphore can be categorized into counting semaphore and binary semaphore.	Mutex is not categorized further.
Operation------------Semaphore value is modified using wait() and signal() operation.	Mutex object is locked or unlocked by the process requesting or releasing the resource.
Resources_Occupied---If all resources are being used, the process requesting for resource performs wait() operation and block itself till semaphore count become greater than one.	If a mutex object is already locked, the process requesting for resources waits and queued by the system till lock is released.
