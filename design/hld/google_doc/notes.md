## File storage. 
Since Google Docs is part of Google Drive, I include the storage feature as well. The system allows users to group files (docs) into folders and support features like edit/create/remove etc.. It works like an OS.

## Online editing and formatting. 

There’s no doubt that one of the core features of Google Docs is online editing. It supports almost everything of Microsoft Office and maybe more.

##Access Control. 

You can share docs with your friends and give different permissions (owner, read-only, allow comment etc.).

## Collaboration. 

It’s truly amazing that Google Docs allows multiple people to edit a single doc simultaneously. This is a technical challenge for sure.
